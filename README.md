# Drowsiness_Detector


The proposed system uses Feature Extraction methodology to determine the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) by analyzing the position and shape of the driver's eyes. The EAR model is an effective method for identifying driver fatigue and can detect whether the driver is awake, drowsy, or asleep. The system uses live video streaming to continuously monitor the driver's condition and provide real-time alerts to prevent potential accidents.

The EAR model can be integrated into various industries, including transport and logistics, to monitor driver fatigue and ensure the safety of drivers and goods. Additionally, it can be used in transportation management systems to optimize routes and schedules based on driver fatigue levels
